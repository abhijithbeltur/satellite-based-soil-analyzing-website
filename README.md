# satellite-based-soil-analyzing-website
This website allows a farmer to input the address of their farm. This address is geocoded to produce a set of coordinates, which is used with the ISGRIDS API to fetch data soil data about that farmer's land. This is used to provide specific recommendations to improve the soil quality and to decrease the soil degradation occurring on their land.
